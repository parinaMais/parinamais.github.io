At the end of last year, I decided to use my holidays to build my first solo game. It was supposed to be a small, three-weeks-project featuring a character you might recognize as my avatar, [who accompanies me since 2020](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKBE6DB_nt/).

Seven months have passed and, since this isn't a post announcing the game's release, it's safe to say my scope was fairly off. From the get-go, I knew I wanted to follow a very simple concept: **you are tired and want to take a bath but, in order to do that, you have to complete some chores.** 

I knew what these chores meant for the character: filling the tub, cleaning the catlitter, etc... But, how do I translate them to the player? Or, better yet, **how do I translate an action in real life to a game mechanic?** 

Figuring out the answer to this question was (and still is) my biggest challenge. And that's what making games is all about! *Isn't it?*

## Making Games

My first solution to that problem was **completing the chores by simply interacting with them**. For that, I created a simple "Look At" system to guide the player towards each interactable object, and an interaction prompt would show up when they were close enough.

The main problem with that was that the game had no challenge. Just pressing a button isn't effort enough, and the character's sense of fulfilment wouldn't translate to the player - the bath isn't a reward if there is no struggle to achieve it. So, in my naive attempt to fix this, I established that the interactions were only possible if they followed a specific order.

Games are very much NOT like that. A big part of making a game is dealing with **player's agency**: here, the player is more than just a spectator, they are actually the ones moving the story forward. If the player doesn't understand a portion of your game and isn't able to move forward, they simply won't reach the end, and won't know the whole story.

I knew from the get-go that this was a game about a character, one that I know very well. And at first, I thought that this was enough: I have a character, I know who he is, what we wants and what he has to do to get it.

What I didn't know back them was that a big part of making a game is communication. A game depends on the player's agency to go forward, and if the player can't understand the who, the want, and the how... Well, the game's pretty much over. And what the first play testing of what was than my tiny game taught me was that I wasn't simply telling stories. I was...

But it quickly became
For the past few months, I’ve been working on my first solo game: it’s called **Catching Fishes**, and it’s about… Taking a bath when you’re very tired.

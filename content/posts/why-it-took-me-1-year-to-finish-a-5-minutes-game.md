**On January 20th, 2026, I released my first solo game**: **CATCHING FISHES**, a short story about taking a bath when you're very tired. But, even though the game itself is about 5 minutes long, developing it took... a bit more than that.

**My work started on December 20th, 2024**. I wanted to make a *tiny* game featuring my main character in the bathroom of his house. At first, it seemed I'd get it done quickly: it didn't take me long to have him walking inside a bathroom.

{{< figure src="/gifs/06_earlyGame.gif" caption="my character was already in the bath ONE YEAR before the game's release!! whaaattt" >}}

But, as it turns out, a game is more than the sum of its parts. And **it was only on January 20th, 2025, that I knew what my game was about**. David Lynch had passed away on the 16th, and a good friend suggested I include an homage to him in my tiny game.

I love Lynch's book *Catching The Big Fish*, and I love his views on ideas, creativity and art. That's where **CATCHING FISHES** comes from: a tribute to Lynch, and to that weird place where ideas are born.

{{< figure src="/img/06_gameIdea.png" alt="image of a notebook page that contains my first notes on the game's title and core concept" caption="this is the official CATCHING FISHES birth certificate!!" >}}

So, **one year before the release**, I already had the game's **title, core concept, environment, main character, and even the movement and interaction mechanics!** 

Why would this project still take 1 whole year?

### A game is an elusive fish

This is a question that's both very easy and surprisingly hard to answer. 

In my [previous **CATCHING FISHES** devlog](https://parinamais.com/posts/catching-fishes-devlog-01/), I focused on the more _practical_ reasons behind the delay. And I'm certain everything I mentioned there, like starting the game in Unreal / taking too long to playtest, contributed to why it took so long.

However, **this time I want to focus on the more... personal, or philosophical reasons**. Now that the game is officially out, it's easier for me to look back and see what I missed. 

To show you what I mean, here's one quote from that previous devlog:

> *"Anyway, when that failed, I decided to remake the chores system from the ground up. Now you can interact with anything at any time, and the obligatory chores have minigames - also, you can go through them in any order. Problem solved, right?"*

This was written in **July of 2025**. At the time, I was working on some minigames, and you can see I was very optimistic about it! But, if you played **CATCHING FISHES**, you know the final game came out **without any minigames!**

So where did they go? What happened to them?

### CATCHING FISHES Secret Level - The MINIGAMES!

Ok, there are no easter eggs, none of the minigames made it into the final game. 

But I actually got pretty far into their development! **I finished six of them, each related to a different bath chore**. The idea was that you would only be able to take a bath after going through every minigame.

Just to show you what they looked like, here's the one you had to beat in order to put on the shorts:

{{< video src="/vid/06_minigameShorts.mp4" type="mp4" caption="please don't get too attached, remember this is discarded concent! it now lives in a TRASH CAN." >}}

And this minigame was pretty well-received! It was a universal favorite for all the playtesters, and I was pretty proud of it.

However, **remember there were SIX of them**, each with a unique mechanic. So getting *ONE* minigame right didn't mean they *ALL* worked. Again, to illustrate what I mean:

{{< video src="/vid/06_minigameCatlitter.mp4" type="mp4" caption="this now lives in the same TRASH CAN as the good stuff. think about that!" >}}

This one was... as fun as it looks! I had just played Mario Wonder and wanted to do something like the invisibility badge, but playtesting proved I didn't deliver.

Basically, the problem with these minigames was that each one of them was, well, a mini **_GAME_**! This means **each one would have to work as a game on its own**, plus, they'd all have to be cohesive - and **BALANCED**! - with each other.

That's quite a **challenge** even for experienced developers, so imagine what it was like for someone making her very first game! And **CHALLENGE** is the keyword here. Again, to quote from my previous devlog:

> "_And I wanted to incorporate this way of thinking into Catching Fishes. After all, what’s the fun of making a game without a little challenge?_"

That quote may seem harmless, but at the time, it was a nagging question that eventually got stuck in my head.

### the Challenges of Making a Game

Minigames came from a perspective of **what my game SHOULD have** in order to really _qualify as a game_. I was trying to answer an imaginary checklist of 'what makes a game good'.

And I'm not saying these demands aren't important, game development is a cruel industry and we have to weigh many factors. But I do believe there are more important things to consider. Like: **what is this game I am making?**

I subscribe to the idea that every creation has a _want_. There's the thing I want to do to my game, but there's also **what my game wants to be**, and I think it's prudent to respect the latter.

This takes many shapes and forms, and sometimes, it's just a matter of discarding a mechanic because _it doesn't fit_, no matter how attached you are to it.

That might seem simple but, in my case, it took about 8 months of development before I truly understood what it means. **I knew from January 20th, 2025 that my game would be centered around this quote**: 

{{< figure src="/gifs/06_quote.gif" caption="thank you, David Lynch!" >}}

**But only on September 8th, 2025 did I truly take it to heart.** That was the day I deleted the minigames, and started working on the music. Or: the day I stopped challenging myself, and just sat quietly for a bit.

### Making a Game Without Challenges

At first, I envisioned minigames as challenges that **contributed to the game's flow**: the player would mirror the character's arc of getting tired and then finally relaxing. But, when I saw them in action, I couldn't help but feel the minigames were **getting in the way**.

They didn't feel right, and I know it's not only a matter of concept, but also of my own skills (will get to that in a minute), but the concept part is also important.

Because **CATCHING FISHES** **is not about the challenge**. 

It's about what happens **AFTER** a challenge. That moment when you get home, and even though things are still a bit chaotic, you know you're finally about to relax.

{{< video src="/vid/06_final.mp4" type="mp4" caption="this was supposed to be the final minigame">}}

And, on a more personal level, **CATCHING FISHES** was about me making my first game. That's where the skills part comes in: I had to create music, systems, character animation, an itch page, think of marketing... All of that for the first time, doing the best I could.

So not only was it important for me to understand the game I was making, it was also important to get **who I was in making this game**. What skills do I have? What can I deliver? What challenges can I overcome?

People who say you should make tiny games are absolutely right, but **one tricky part is actually measuring the size of tiny that you can undertake**. For me, trying to cram in SIX additional _mini_ games was an absolute overkill. I couldn't do it.

So why did I even try? Just writing it down makes it read like a bad idea, why spend 4 months on this when everything else was already pretty challenging?

Turns out, the answer is pretty simple.

### I didn't want to make my _FIRST_ game

There's a gamedev cliché that is really true, and it happens a lot. It's about the 12-year-old who wants to make a multiplayer MMO all alone as their first game, and, of course, it never gets done.

Well, **trying to pack six different minigames into my first game was my MMO**. It took me a while to accept **CATCHING FISHES** for what it was: a simple, 5-minute game about taking a bath when you're very tired. 

In part, it's like that because that's the idea that I fished, and it was an honor bringing it to life. But it's also because, well, **that's what I could deliver**.

I kept wanting it to be more and more, and maybe on some level, I just wanted myself to be more. I wanted to be able to create fully fledged minigames, additional animated characters (the cat!), cutscenes for every interaction, but... I can't. Not yet.

Because, you see, **CATCHING FISHES** is my first game. And that means something.

{{< figure src="/gifs/06_carequinhaBanho.gif" caption="" >}}


It means it's the start of my journey. I'm still learning! **Ideas are beautiful, unique, and limitless beings. But they are tied to our skills and efforts**. And no matter how much energy and willingness I put into it, some things are still out of reach.

Accepting this was, ultimately, what made me get this game done. It took me a while, it certainly could have taken less, but it also could have taken more.

I could still be trying to craft a perfect game, with lots of animation, mechanics, and _content_. Instead, I made a short and simple game. 

But it's done. It's out there! I can finally relax!

And take a well-deserved bath.
